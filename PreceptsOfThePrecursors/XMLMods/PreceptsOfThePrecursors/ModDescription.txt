A fan made expansion pack, adding in a large quantity of new quality content.

Dyson Precursors:
An initially weak Dyson Mothership will scour the galaxy, consuming mines whole in order to expand its area of influence, locking down entire sections of the galaxy.
With enough shows of force, it may eventually learn to respect you as a loyal follower, offering you valuable protection.

Neinzul Enclave Migration:
Roaming Enclaves have arrived into the galaxy, and will build Hives and protect whatever faction they have called their home.
They will attempt to team up with all teams enabled in the game, and can have their logic greatly customized in galaxy settings.

Ancestors' Arks:
A large quantity of exceptionally odd Arks can be found all around the galaxy. In addition, the brand new Scrapyard will allow you a greater choice in what Arks you desire.

Sleepers:
A large number of defensive powerhouses, inactive at first. Can be awoken by you or your enemies in order to gain a powerful defensive ally.

Neinzul War Chroniclers:
Drawn to conflict, these Neinzul will warp into fights between opposing factions, and base future fleet layouts on the ships they see.
