A fan made expansion pack consisting of three parts: The Dyson Precursors, The Roaming Enclaves, and The Goon Squad.

Dyson Precursors:
A (relatively) small Dyson Mothership is scouring the galaxy looking for resources. It appears weak, but whoes to say what would happen if this ship manages to achieve its goal?
This Mothership will work to gather resources and rebuild Zenith control over the galaxy, completely consuming Metal Generators to produce Dyson Nodes to secure territory it considers its own.
Time will tell if you'll have a place in this new Zenith empire.

Neinzul Enclave Migration:
A grand migration, the Neinzul are returning to the galaxy. Lead by individually weak Enclaves, these Neinzul desire to continue their legacy, and will stake their claim to the galaxy with various Hives.
Should you deem the cost worthy, you'll find yourself housing a new species within your borders, using vast swarms of Younglings and Clanlings to bolster your empire.
Be wary, for you are not the Enclaves' only potential ally.

Ancestors' Arks:
While war has been a fairly to the point business throughout human history, there have been many outliers in the traditional design sense.
A large number of exotic centerpieces have been found in the galaxy. It is up to us to claim them for our own use.
