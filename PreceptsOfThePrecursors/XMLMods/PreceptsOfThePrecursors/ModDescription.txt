A fan made expansion pack.

Dyson Precursors:
An initially weak Dyson Mothership will scour the galaxy, consuming mines whole in order to expand its area of influence.

Neinzul Enclave Migration:
Roaming Enclaves have arrived into the galaxy, and will build Hives and protect whatever faction they have called their home.

Ancestors' Arks:
A large quantity of exceptionally odd Arks can be found all around the galaxy. In addition, the brand new Scrapyard will allow you a greater choice in what Arks you desire.

Sleepers:
A large number of defensive powerhouses, inactive at first. Can be awoken by you or your enemies in order to gain a powerful defensive ally.

Neinzul War Chroniclers:
Drawn to conflict, these Neinzul will warp into fights between opposing factions, and base future fleet layouts on the ships they see.
