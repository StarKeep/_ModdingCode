        full_text="Commander? You’re gonna wanna see this… we’ve spotted another one of those giant Zenith beings. Unlike the neutral Trader or perpetually ravenous Devourer, this one seems much more… active… to say the least. We’ve noticed it engaging the AI. Only time will tell if it is also hostile to us."

        full_text="Commander? The energy readings that it gives off is staggering! Anyways, it seems like the Zenith Mothership doesn’t actively participate in combat, but delegates almost all of the combat to smaller zenith organisms to fight for it hence the name. It seems to be approaching our territory. The AI’s been trying to take it down, but as for who shot first I’m not sure. If it was the AI, we might have a potential ally on our side. If the Zenith Mothership shot first… we may have a bit of trouble inbound, to put it lightly."

        full_text="Uh… Commander? The Zenith Mothership is on one of our planets… We’ve received a transmission from it, and it reads as follows:

Ah, finally, a respite from the silent one.
This… calmness… I can appreciate.
I do not desire us to fight, my hostile intent, none.

I have awoken from my slumber, but my kin are gone.
It seems I must fulfill my duty, to restore my race to it’s former glory.
Given enough time, I shall rebuild, and usher in a new dawn.

From what the science crew and I’ve been able to gather is that the Zenith Mothership has been attacked by the AI and was recently awakened from a sort of stasis or hibernation. We think that it is attempting to rebuild the Zenith race, but given how little we know of the Zenith, it’s difficult to predict what exactly the Zenith Mothership will do. "

  <journal name="MothershipTrust" sidebar_text="Guide: Mothership Trust"
           chat_text="A guide for interacting with the mothership has been posted in the journals section."
           full_text="The Mothership starts out respecting your space as your own, and will not, usually, attack you on your planets.

She will passively gain Trust towards your ownership on planets where you exert a military advantage without damaging her.

Be warned however, that if her trust towards on a planet ever drops to -2000, she will attack on sight while there.

On the opposing end, prove that you are worthy on neutral planets, and raise your trust above 1000, and she will deem the planet under your control, no longer acting hostile while there."

           chat_text="A guide for interacting with the mothership has been posted in the journals section."
           full_text="The Mothership is but a single entity, and delegates the control of her territory to two subfactions, the Suppressors, and the Protectors.
           
The Suppressors will destroy absolutely any non-Zenith that enter the planet, regardless of anything. If these are found on a planet, this is hers. Full stop. You will have to fight an uphill battle to claim it for your own.

The Protectors will also destroy non-Zenith that enter the planet, but have made an exception for her allies. These can coexist alongside allied forces, but end to be notably weaker than their Suppressor equivilents."
