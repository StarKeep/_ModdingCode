  <!--These drone "fleets" build a full cap of each type that is a potential within them,
      which means that they are not really procedural at all.  When a ship says "I am in the 'HiveGolemDrones' fleet and my max cap is 5,"
      all drone producers that use 'HiveGolemDrones' will have 5 of that type of ship.
      
      The weight tag is also not used on these (it's just set to 1) because they are not actually chosen from at random at any time.
      
      The potential_ships stuff is not used, because the definitions of ships themselves say what are in there, and we don't have any limitations on types of categories.
      The ships themselves are filled elsewhere by ships saying "I'm in that fleet" versus this file referencing them directly.-->
