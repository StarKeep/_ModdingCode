Your military advisor says leaving it to it’s own devices may be it’s own reward, but to remain cautious around it, especially when in potentially hostile territory."

Your lead Scientist believes this behaviour is that the Proto Dyson and Dyson Mothership sees us as a tool that has kept it alive when it was weaker, and desires to make sure that it’s tool remains unbroken. Curiously, it appears that this sphere is harnessing excess energy that we are unable to capture. This may inhibit its maturation, but lets us harness all the energy we need. Your military advisor believes that the Protector Sphere can be interfaced with our hackers, based on the signals we’ve been receiving from the sphere, in order to design ships based around the Dyson Sentinels and Defenders.
