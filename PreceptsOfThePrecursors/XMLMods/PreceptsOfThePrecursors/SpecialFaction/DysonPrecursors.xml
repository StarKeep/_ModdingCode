This Mothership will work to gather resources and rebuild Zenith control over the galaxy, completely consuming Metal Generators to produce defensive structures to secure territory it considers its own. Time will tell if you'll have a place in this new Zenith takeover.

&lt;color=#800080&gt;EXTREMELY HIGH IMPACT:&lt;/color&gt; This faction can permanently modify the galaxy's landscape, consuming metal generators in the early game, and locking down entire sections of the galaxy late game.">
