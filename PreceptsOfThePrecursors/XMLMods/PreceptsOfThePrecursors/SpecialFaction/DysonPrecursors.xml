This Mothership will work to gather resources and rebuild Zenith control over the galaxy, completely consuming Metal Generators to produce Dyson Nodes to secure territory it considers its own. Time will tell if you'll have a place in this new Zenith takeover.

&lt;color=#f25e1c&gt;HIGH IMPACT:&lt;/color&gt; This faction can permanently modify the galaxy, capable of bringing intense pressure to planets and semi-permanently removing resources from planets.">
