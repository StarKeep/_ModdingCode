    description="An ancient subgroup of Neinzul have noticed the large collection of races and technology located within our galaxy, and it has peaked their interest.
	
They will periodically invade planets with fights occuring on them, attempting to cause chaos to mask their true intentions: To study how others make war.

&lt;color=#f25e1c&gt;MEDIUM IMPACT:&lt;/color&gt; This faction can never truly hold territory, and seeks to simply sow chaos in the galaxy for its own study.
They will send progressively larger waves to impact fights throughout the galaxy, slowly copying the makeup of ships they find.
They are only drawn to conflict; and will rarely show their faces on peaceful worlds.">
