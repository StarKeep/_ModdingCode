This file is included as a full guide to tagging for integration.

Civilian Industries economy is split into two halves: Trade and Industry.
If you tag for one, do not tag for the other.
Trade is the Production and Spreading of resources.
Industry is the Usage of resources to produce entities.

Special tags:
*All of these tags are intended for 'self contained' resouce systems.
*If you want your faction to be able to build its own cargo ships, instead of relying on a friendly Civilian faction, you'll need a Grand Shipyard.
CivGrandShipyard - Enabler tag, allow this entity to create Cargo ships.
CivGrandShipyardSpawnsX - Shipyard spawns a random entity with the tag X to fulfill trade demands.
*If not set, it will simply create regular Cargo Ships.
*The entity requested MUST have CivCargoShip set.
CivCargoShip - Treats the entity as a Cargo Ship.
*Do not use with CivTrade or CivIndustry tag.
*Most be mobile.
*Can optionally set CivStorageX to change the amount of resources stored on the entity. Defaults to 100.

Trade tags:
CivTrade - Enabler tag, consider the entity part of the Trade network.
*Do not use with CivIndustry tag.
CivImport - Allows the entity to send Import requests.
*Used for stationary storage objects, such as Trade Stations.
CivProXXY - Produces a resource named Y XX times per second. (CivPro03Iron produces 3 Iron per second. Must use two digits.)
CivRandomX - Causes the entity to pick X random CivPro tags to use when spawned.
*Check Metal Generator for an example. It defines 9 resources, and uses CivRandomX to pick one of them to use.
*Resources are picked on a planet by planet basis. So all Metal Generators on a planet would produce the same resource.
CivStorageX - How much of each resource the entity can store. Defaults to 100 if Mobile, 2500 if Stationary. Values over 10000 not recommended.

Industry tags: (No storage tags. They all have a pre-built stockpile based on cost.)
CivIndustry - Enabler tag, consider the entity part of the Industrial network.
*Do not use with CivTrade tag.
*Do NOT put on Neutral entities.
CivBuild/UnitName/UnitCapacity/ResourceName/ResourceCost
*Example: CivBuild/VWing/50/Iron/Auto10,CivBuild/FusionBomber/40/Steel/8000
*Must be in that exact order.
*Resource cost may be set as AutoX, in which case the cost will be equal to the entity's cost_for_ai_to_purchase times X.
*Unit Capacity is ONLY checked on initial entity creation. It can be freely adjusted in cSharp by doing entity.GetIndustry().Capacity["Iron"] = 500.
*Unit Capacity is a 'soft' cap. It will stop requesting after reaching this unit count, but it won't cancel incoming trade ships.
CivBuildForOwner
*By default, any unit built at an Industry will have their ownership transfered to an allied Civilian Industry faction.
*If this tag is set, ownership will not change and they will remain under the control of their builder's faction.
*These units will be stored in a CivFleet assigned to the built object, and can be accessed via entity.GetCivFleet()
